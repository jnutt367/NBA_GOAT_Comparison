# NBA_GOAT_Comparison
## I will make the case that MJ was by far, the best winner and has the statistics to prove it
### I am creating with MongoDB Charts, several different types of charts available in MongoDB Charts
## The purpose for this repository is to improve my charting skills, aggregation pipeline understanding and practice with data modeling.
### You would be surprised how much I learned just by thinking about how to design the schema for the GOAT stats and which ones would need to be accessed together.
